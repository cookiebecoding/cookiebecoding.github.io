        <h1>A Friendship Summarized in <emph>3 Years of Whatsapp Messages</emph></h1>
        <p>Just like undoubtely many of you have several Whatsapp group chats in which you communicate on a daily basis with your closest friends, so do I. 
          Recently I decided to scroll all the way up in our group chat, only to conclude that there were over 3 years worth of messages in the chat.
          I couldn't help but wonder how many messages were in there, how it evolved over time, as well as if my messaging behaviour was similar to that of my friends.
          So I decided to download the entire chat history and analyse the cr&#128169p out of it.<br>
          I invite you to ignore all privacy objections my friends will surely have against me posting this analysis to the internet and take a look into me and my friends' personal messages from the past 3 years!
        <note-inline>(<a class='scrolly' href='#data'>Scroll down</a> to the data.)</note-inline>
        </p>
        <h3 id='data'>A summary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>a group of <emph>7 friends</emph>, let's call them Janice, Sharon, Ashley, Joanne, Lucille, Susan and Jessica (they're the best!);</li>
          <li><emph>8.358 messages</emph> sent;</li>
          <li>during a period of <emph>1.094 days</emph> (the 29th of July 2017 to the 27th of July 2020);</li>
          <li>of which we talked on Whatsapp <emph>625 days</emph> (or on average 4 out of 7 days);</li>
          <li>and on each day we talked, we sent on average <emph>13 messages per day</emph>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Let's go aaaall the way back</h3>
        <p>
          The first messages date from the 29th of July, 2017. This is when I got a new phone, so messages sent before that day, are sadly lost.
        </p>
        <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-21by9">
          <iframe src="assets/chart_evolution.html" style='border:none'></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
          In general, the volume of messages has increased over time. There are big differences however from day to day and even between months. 
          Also notice the peak of messages in March of this year. 
          This undoubtely is linked to the Covid-19 situation and the related lockdown, when we were all in quarantaine and we started messaging and calling each other as if there was no tomorrow (to be fair, that could actually have been the case).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let's have a look at the number of messages each person sent over time.<br> 
          Click on a name to toggle between my friends' message histories.
        </p>
        <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-21by9">
          <iframe src="assets/chart_sender_month.html" style='border:none'></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
          There is a big difference in the volume of messages sent by each of my friends. We do see similarities in the evolution over the entire period though.
          Similarly as described above, since 2017 there has been a gradual increase in messages for everyone, with a sudden increase in volume in March/April of this year.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>I miss you most on Thursday nights and Saturday mornings</h3>
        <p>
          If we look at the days and times we sent the most messages in the past years, the main conclusion is that we seek contact at very divers moments.
        </p>
        <div class='row'>
          <div class='col-md-7 text-center'>
            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-21by9">
              <iframe src="assets/chart_heatmap_hour_day.html" style='border:none'></iframe>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class='col-md-5 text-center'>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          We text each other both during the week and on weekends. Most messages are sent on Monday nights, Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. 
          Saturday is overall also the day we text the most, probably because historically when we meet, often this has been on Saturdays.
          A lot of those texts were thus probably to arrange practicalities such as 'Where are we meeting?', 'Should I pick up someone?', etc.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Different types of texters</h3>

        <p>
          You might have aready noticed in the histogram above that there is a big difference in frequency of texts between my friends.
          If you have a look at the 2 charts below, you will see that this not only has to do with how much my friends like or dislike texting, but that we are just very different types of texters.
        </p>

              The 1st chart shows that my friends who text the most (Ashley, Jessica and Sharon) don't send as lengthy messages as the people who text less (Lucille, Janice and Joanne). 
              Whereas Sharon, Jessica and Ashley probably split up what they are sharing with us in several messages, Lucille, Janice and Joanne seem to bundle what they have to say more together in lengthier messages.<br>
              For Sharon and Ashley for instance, we also see that they send a lot emoji's, which might also explain why they send more short messages, because they might sometimes react with just an (or multiple) emoji (eg. 'hahaha &#128514&#128514')
              There is one exception, Susan, and I'll give you an insight in my friends' personalities to have you better understand why. 
              Let's get you familiar with my friends:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <emph>Sharon.</emph> The enthusiastic and fun one.<br>
                  As you can see from the 2 graphs above, she is sending by far the most messages and also using a lot of emoji's. This is because she is often the one initiating conversations, sending jokes, memes, songs and trying to get our group together to meet up.
                  She is the Monica to our friends. If you don't know <a href='https://data.whicdn.com/images/197722250/original.jpg'>what I'm talking about</a>, I like you a little less right now.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  <emph>Jessica.</emph> The warm-hearted one.<br> 
                  Definitely always a part of our conversations, I have the impression that she hardly ever skips one. She's always very interested in our lives and eager to include us in hers as well.
                  Aside from the serious stuff, also always up for a laugh. She's the one you want by your side at a party.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <emph>Ashley.</emph> The one who's always there.<br>
                  Ashley probably has one of the busiest schedules in our group, as she sometimes has crazy working hours, she does a lot of sports in her free time and in addition to that she has several other interests.
                  She however is never so busy that she will ignore us and she will therefore often reply with emoji-only messages at first, but then later on be sure to participate anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <emph>Susan.</emph> The non-texter.<br> 
                  Always has, always will be. I was honestly pretty amazed that there even are some emoji's in her chart. I'm sure that if I could make an emoji chart of 5 years ago, it would be completely empty. 
                  In contrast to this, she is also the one who's always up for a meet-up in person to spend some quality time with her friends.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <emph>Lucille.</emph> Not gonna lie, this is me.<br> 
                  Always up for jokes (hence the happy emoji's) and check-ins with my friends, but I seldomly initiate the convo's myself. Like Susan I'm not the world's best texter, often not even having my smartphone on me for several hours.
                  Looking at my histogram, I do think however that I've made some progress. I was worse 2 years ago.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <emph>Janice.</emph> Probably a mix between Ashley and Susan, texting-wise.<br>
                  She's very active and enjoys her screen-free time a lot. I suspect she often doesn't have her smartphone at hand either. However, at the same time she's genuinely interested in each of our lives and she does always make sure to actively take part, even if it it's only at the end of the day.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <emph>Joanne.</emph> The one with the million hobbies and other friend groups.<br/>
                  I suspect that Joanne get's looots of group messages outside of our little group, which probably explains why she doesn't send as much texts, but hers are the lengthiest of the entire group.
                  This is in line with my impressions of, her texting behaviour, ie. that she hardly ever misses a conversation.
                </li> 
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>In conclusion, I think our texting habits do reflect the different personalities each of my friends have, and I think it is exactly these different personalities that make this group so much fun to be around.</p>
